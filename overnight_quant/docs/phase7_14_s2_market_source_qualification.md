# Phase 7.14: S2 Market Source Qualification

## Scope

S2 adds three Eastmoney direct-HTTP candidates without changing close-confirmation
readiness, strategy weights, or trading behavior.

| Capability | Provider | Production state | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| market breadth | Eastmoney all-A clist plus Eastmoney SSE index | candidate | unqualified, 0/3 |
| industry mapping and breadth | Eastmoney stock industry plus industry board clist | candidate | unqualified, 0/3 |
| minute fund flow | Eastmoney push2 fflow kline | candidate | unqualified, 0/3 |

Sina fund flow remains proxy/audit-only. It cannot replace or complete an
Eastmoney batch. None of the three candidates is executable through the public
production adapter path before PM approves three consecutive complete trading
days.

## Field contracts

The market record uses `origin_source=eastmoney` for both components. The fixed
benchmark is SSE Composite (`secid=1.000001`). The all-A stock pool is
`m:0+t:6,m:0+t:80,m:1+t:2,m:1+t:23` and is versioned as
`eastmoney_all_a_m0t6_80_m1t2_23_v1`.

```text
valid_count = up_count + down_count + flat_count
total_count = valid_count + invalid_count
breadth_ratio = up_count / valid_count
```

The provider rejects a partial stock pool, an internally inconsistent count,
or a missing Eastmoney benchmark timestamp. It never combines a Tencent index
with Eastmoney breadth.

Industry mapping and industry breadth both use the Eastmoney industry
classification `eastmoney_industry_m90t2_v1`. Every fixed stock must map by an
exact industry name to one board row. Industry breadth uses the same count
formula as market breadth.

Fund-flow values are denominated in CNY. Each row describes one minute interval
(`value_semantics=minute_interval_net_flow`,
`aggregation_semantics=incremental`). Every fixed stock must have an exact
14:50 event row. A missing stock or a later completion rejects the entire
provider batch.

## Timing and network boundary

Providers have no default network construction in the adapter registry. The
validation command requires `--network`, runs each provider batch in a killable
child process, and enforces an absolute collection deadline. There is one
attempt only: no retry, fallback, demo data, or cross-source stitching.

Raw responses and evidence are written only to ignored cache using exclusive,
atomic UTF-8 creation. Verification requires an externally supplied file
SHA-256 and reconstructs all normalized records from captured raw bytes.
Failure evidence can pass integrity verification, but cannot become a qualified
day.

## Qualification gate

Each qualifying day must have all three providers complete before the deadline,
cover all five fixed stocks where applicable, and contain no timeout, late,
wrong-window, source-identity, unit, or provenance failure. Qualification
requires three consecutive trusted trading days. A failed day resets the
sequence; code never updates the count automatically.

The initial implementation deliberately does not run a real validation on
2026-09-18. The provider contracts and targeted tests were not treated as
sufficient evidence for an intraday Go/No-Go, and no hurried sampling was
started. Current state remains:
